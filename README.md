This program implements a JavaFX GUI Application of the game Wordle. To run the program, initiate WordleApplication.java to open up the Wordle GUI.

The application will prompt the user to enter in 6 guesses and return the results of the guess compared to the answer with color results. Green represents the correct placement of the corresponding letter, yellow represents the existence of the corresponding letter in the answer, and gray communicates that the corresponding letter is not in the answer.

The game will end when the user completes 6 guesses or guesses the correct answer. If the user guesses the correct answer, they will be notified with the number of guesses they took to win. If the user loses, the correct answer is given.

When the game is over, the user will be prompted with the option to play again given a Yes or No button.
